### Calculate Calories
Simple Windows Form Application to calculate the number of calories consumed based on the number of grams of fat and carbs.

### What I Learned
This isn't necessarily something that I learned, but more of a question that I have.
So far I have seen two different ways to handle invalid input when using the TryParse() method.
One is to put it in a conditional block, and execute the based on the return value.
This seems like the way it was intended to be used.
However I would think to put it in a try block, which I have tried as well and I know that this also works. I think if you put it in a try block, you know more about the incorrect data and can provide better responses from the program based on the exceptions that are thrown.
